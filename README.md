# Mercator Map

Mercator Map is a port to JavaScript of the original Java utility class MercatorMap
by Till Nagel to convert between geo-locations and Cartesian screen coordinates.

It was developed as a component of the [Tweeting Map](https://github.com/nunobaldaia/tweetingmap)
experimental visualization of near-realtime public geo-localized tweets.
